      EXAMPLES
      1.3 Let C1 be the group .Z;C/, and, for an integer m  1, let Cm be the group .Z=mZ;C/.
      1.4 Permutation groups. Let S be a set and let Sym.S / be the set of bijections ˛WS ! S.
      We define the product of two elements of Sym.S / to be their composite:
      ˛ˇ D ˛ ıˇ:
      In other words, .˛ˇ/.s/ D ˛.ˇ.s// for all s 2 S. For any ˛;ˇ;
       2 Sym.S / and s 2 S,
      ..˛ ıˇ/ ı
      /.s/ D .˛ ıˇ/.
      .s// D ˛.ˇ.
      .s/// D .˛ ı .ˇ ı
       //.s/; (5)
      and so associativity holds. The identity map s 7! s is an identity element for Sym.S /, and
      inverses exist because we required the elements of Sym.S / to be bijections. Therefore
      Sym.S / is a group, called the group of symmetries of S. For example, the permutation
      group on n letters Sn is defined to be the group of symmetries of the set f1;:::;ng — it has
      order nŠ.
      1.5 When G and H are groups, we can construct a new group G H, called the (direct)
      product of G and H. As a set, it is the cartesian product of G and H, and multiplication is
      defined by
      .g; h/.g0
      ; h0
      / D .gg0
      ; hh0
      </p><p>The theory of groups of finite order may be said to date from the time of Cauchy. To
        him are due the first attempts at classification with a view to forming a theory from a
        number of isolated facts. Galois introduced into the theory the exceedingly important
        idea of a [normal] sub-group, and the corresponding division of groups into simple
        and composite. Moreover, by shewing that to every equation of finite degree there
        corresponds a group of finite order on which all the properties of the equation depend,
        Galois indicated how far reaching the applications of the theory might be, and thereby
        contributed greatly, if indirectly, to its subsequent developement.
        Many additions were made, mainly by French mathematicians, during the middle
        part of the [nineteenth] century. The first connected exposition of the theory was
        given in the third edition of M. Serret’s “Cours d’Algebre Sup ` erieure, ´ ” which was
        published in 1866. This was followed in 1870 by M. Jordan’s “Traite des substitutions ´
        et des equations alg ´ ebriques. ´ ” The greater part of M. Jordan’s treatise is devoted to a
        developement of the ideas of Galois and to their application to the theory of equations.
        No considerable progress in the theory, as apart from its applications, was made
        till the appearance in 1872 of Herr Sylow’s memoir “Theor ´ emes sur les groupes de `
        substitutions” in the fifth volume of the Mathematische Annalen. Since the date of this
        memoir, but more especially in recent years, the theory has advanced continuously</p></pre>
