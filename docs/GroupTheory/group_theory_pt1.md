# Notations in Group Theory

## NOTATION

We use standard Bourbaki notations:

$\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$

$\mathbb{Q}$ is the field of rational numbers

$\mathbb{R}$ is the field of real numbers

$\mathbb{C}$ is the field of complex numbers

$\mathbb{F}_q$ is a finite field with $q$ elements
where $q$ is a power of a prime number

In particular, $\mathbb{F}_p=\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ for $p$ a prime number

For integers $m$ and $n$, $m{\mid}n$ means that $m$ divides $n$, i.e., $n \in m\mathbb{Z}$

$X\approx Y$ $X$ is isomorphism to $Y$

$X\simeq Y$ $X$ and $Y$ are canonically isomorphic (or there is a given or unique isomorphism)
